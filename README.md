# FCC: Force Directed Graph

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/aftab515/pen/rNrzBPx](https://codepen.io/aftab515/pen/rNrzBPx).

User Story: I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.

User Story: I can see each country's flag on its node.

Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DealPete/forceDirected/master/countries.json

Hint: You can create a spritesheet of national flags at https://www.flag-sprites.com.
